		<p>If you like my work you can buy me a coconut water <a href="https://www.paypal.me/andreasblaesius"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg" alt="PayPal" /></a>.</p>
		<p>Another way to make me happy would be if you donate to an organization who cares about (kids having) cancer. I had blood cancer in 2001 (when i was 12/13 years old) and i am happy being still alive.</p>
		<p>A good choice of an organisation to donate to would be the <a href="http://www.dkms.de/en">DKMS</a> (they also accept donations via paypal), but any other similar organisation will be good too.</p>
